Given user question:   What is the smallest hummingbird?
***********************************************************************
Top 10 results from Bag of words algorithm are:
Two white eggs are laid, which despite being the smallest of all bird eggs, are in fact large relative to the adult hummingbird's size. Incubation lasts 14 to 23 days, depending on the species, ambient temperature, and female attentiveness to the nest. The mother feeds her nestlings on small arthropods and nectar by inserting her bill into the open mouth of a nestling, and then regurgitating the food into its crop. 1.0
Hummingbirds drink nectar from hummingbird feeders and flowers. They eat small soft insects and bugs. 0.8660254037844388
The calliope hummingbird is the smallest bird species in North America and measures just 3 inches long. The bee hummingbird is the smallest hummingbird species in the world and measures 2.25 inches long. It is only found in Cuba. 0.8660254037844387
A hummingbird is born from an egg that is the size of a very small pea. They will spend about three weeks in the nest. When they are old enough, they will fly away and not return to the nest. If they can survive the first year of life, they will live for approximately 5 years. 0.8164965809277261
It depends on the size of the bird. The largest, the Giant Hummingbird, has a wingbeat rate of 10-15 per second. The fastest recorded rate was about 80 per second, on a tiny Amethyst Woodstar, and the slightly smaller Bee Hummingbird - the world's smallest bird - may have an even faster rate. Common small North American hummingbirds like the Ruby-throated and Rufous average around 53 per second in normal flight. 0.8164965809277261
A hummingbird's brilliant throat color is not caused by feather pigmentation, but rather by iridescence in the arrangement of the feathers. Light level, moisture, angle of viewing, wear and tear and other factors all influence just how bright and colorful the throat may appear. 0.8164965809277261
Roughly 25-30 percent of a hummingbird's weight is in its pectoral muscles. These are the broad chest muscles principally responsible for flight. 0.8164965809277261
Hummingbirds lay the smallest eggs of all birds. Their eggs measure less than one-half inch long but may represent as much as 10 percent of the mother's weight at the time the eggs are laid. A hummingbird egg is smaller than a jelly bean! 0.8164965809277261
The bill of the aptly named sword-billed hummingbird, found in the Andes Mountains, can reach up to 4 inches long, and it can be so heavy that the birds may perch holding their bills straight up. These birds hold the record for the longest bill relative to overall body size of any bird in the world. 0.8164965809277261
Habitat loss and destruction are the hummingbird's main threats. As hummingbirds are often specially adapted to each unique habitat, each species of hummingbird currently listed as vulnerable or endangered on the IUCN red list are all threatened due to habitat destruction and loss. The earth's changing temperatures due to climate change are affecting hummingbird migratory patterns. Different species are being spotted well outside there normal range. Due to this, it may be harder for them to find food. 0.7537783614444091
