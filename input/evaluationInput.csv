What is the rate of flight of a hummingbird in the air?,A hummingbird flies at an average speed of 25-30 miles per hour and can do a fast dive at up to 60 miles per hour.
Can hummingbirds harm a flower?,No. Flowers love hummingbirds. Flowers need hummingbirds to help with pollination. Plants will position their flowers outward so the hummingbirds can easily reach them.
Are nests used again?,Hummingbirds can reuse their nest if the nest survives the winter months. Do not try to save a nest for a hummingbird since illegal in the United States and many other countries.
Might a hummingbird use a termite or an insect as a food source?,Not really. Termites have a tough exoskeleton that hummingbirds don't like to have to deal with unless they have to. Hummingbirds prefer softer insects.
During which seasons do hummingbirds settle down in their nests?,"In North America, hummingbirds will nest in the spring and early summer. In South and Central America, hummingbird will nest in both the summer and the winter (North American time)."
Do scents help hummingbirds find a flower?,"Hummingbirds have little or no sense of smell. Most good hummingbird plants have no fragrance, and the hummingbird plants that do have a fragrance [Japanese honeysuckle, for instance] are exotics, usually Asian or African in origin. Therefore it would be incorrect to say that hummingbirds are drawn to any flowers because of the scent."
"When migrating, will hummingbirds perch on different types of birds for a continuous trip with no effort?","The ruby-throated hummingbird flies 500 miles nonstop across the Gulf of Mexico during both its spring and fall migrations. It is a myth, however, that these tiny birds ""ride"" on the back of other birds during migration - they fly this distance completely on their own."
What scent can hummingbirds detect?,Hummingbirds have no sense of smell but have very keen eyesight.
How is food consumed and what body parts are used?,"Hummingbirds do not suck nectar through their long bills, they lick it with fringed, forked tongues. Capillary action along the fringe of their tongue helps draw nectar up into their throats so they can swallow."
What continents are hummingbirds located in?,"Hummingbirds are native species of the New World and are not found outside of the Western Hemisphere except in a few zoos or aviaries. There are no hummingbirds found in Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia or Antarctica."
