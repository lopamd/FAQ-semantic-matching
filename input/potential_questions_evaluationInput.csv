What is the length of time that hummingbirds will be alive?,"Not much is known about their lifespan, but many experts believe the average is about 3 to 5 years. The current record holder is a female Broad-tailed Hummingbird. She was banded as an adult in Colorado in 1976 and recaptured in the same location in 1987, which would have made her at least 12 years old."
How many genera or sorts of hummingbirds can one find?,"There are more than 325 unique hummingbird species in the world. Only eight species regularly breed in the United States, though up to two dozen species may visit the country or be reported as regular vagrants. The rest of the hummingbirds are primarily tropical species and do not regularly migrate. They are found in Central and South America as well as throughout the Caribbean."
18 Is the hue of the larynx influenced by external factors?,"A hummingbird's brilliant throat color is not caused by feather pigmentation, but rather by iridescence in the arrangement of the feathers. Light level, moisture, angle of viewing, wear and tear and other factors all influence just how bright and colorful the throat may appear."
What do they use their appendiges for and how do they move around?,"Hummingbirds cannot walk or hop, though their feet can be used to scoot sideways while they are perched. These birds have evolved smaller feet to be lighter for more efficient flying. They will use their feet for itching and preening, however!"
How little can hummingbirds get and what is the length?,The calliope hummingbird is the smallest bird species in North America and measures just 3 inches long. The bee hummingbird is the smallest hummingbird species in the world and measures 2.25 inches long. It is only found in Cuba.
How much plumage do these birds have and is that amount high?,"Hummingbirds have 1,000-1,500 feathers, the fewest number of feathers of any bird species in the world. Not only do they not need as many feathers because of their tiny size, but fewer feathers also keeps them more lightweight for easier flight."
What which muscle has the greatest percentage of weight?,Roughly 25-30 percent of a hummingbird's weight is in its pectoral muscles. These are the broad chest muscles principally responsible for flight.
Is it true that a hummingbird lays the tiniest of ova?,Hummingbirds lay the smallest eggs of all birds. Their eggs measure less than one-half inch long but may represent as much as 10 percent of the mother's weight at the time the eggs are laid. A hummingbird egg is smaller than a jelly bean!
What is the rate of breath intake for hummingbirds?,"At rest, a hummingbird takes an average of 250 breaths per minute. Their breathing pace will increase when they are in flight."
What is the farthest a hummingbird flies when it migrates?,"The rufous hummingbird has the longest migration of any hummingbird species. These hummers fly more than 3,000 miles from their nesting grounds in Alaska and Canada to their winter habitat in Mexico."
